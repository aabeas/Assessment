## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.


### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope: A generalized term divided into two types, global scope and local scope. Global scope includes variables contained in the outer area of a program.  They can be accessed by other variables and functions that are global, as well as those that are local. Variables and functions written within a function, are consider to be in local scope. From this position they are isolated or bound, they are not accessible by global variables or functions.

#### Hoisting: Computer's (or programmer's, when correcting or completing another's code) attempt to properly place, raise, a declaration, for a variable or function, so that it can be accounted for prior to a call or execution.

#### Compartmentalization: Concept for organizing and isolating code into functions that are self contained. This approach attempts to minimize unintended issues when making changes to discreet areas and from polluting and inversely effecting  global scope.
